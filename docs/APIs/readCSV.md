# Read a CSV file

The readCSV functions reads the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. And for subsequent use of the time filtering functions, we need to introduce the new_time column name in advance and transform it. This function reads the csv file, standardizes the columns for case id, timestamp and event, and creates a new Column called ‘new _time’. For consistency, all column names are transformed to lowercase and special characters are removed.

>Note: all other supporting functions require you start by invoking [readCSV()](./APIs/readCSV.md), [readExcel()](./APIs/readExcel.md) or [readPanda()](./APIs/readPanda.md). This is so that the column names for case_id, event and timestamp are kept consistent throughout.

## Usage
``
readCSV (String fileName, String case_id_col_name,String event_col_name,String timestamp_col_name,String format)
``

## Arguments
- `filename` is the name of the CSV file we want to import.
- `case_id_col_name` is the name of the time column in the source CSV file.
- `event_col_name` is the name of the event column in the source CSV file.
- `timestamp_col_name` is the name of the timestamp column in the source CSV file.
- `format` is the timestamp format used in the source CSV file. If left blank, the default value is %d/%m/%Y %H:%M.

## Return
Returns a Pandas DataFrame. The case id, event and timestamp column names from the source file will be renamed and standardized to the following column names (respectively): case_id,event,timestamp

## Example
```
data=pm.readCSV('eventlog.csv','Case.ID','eventaction','Datetime',"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
```
This will read the CSV file under the current path to the Pandas dataframe which has been created called data. Table1 (below) is an example of a source dataset file. Table2 gives an example of the output from the readExcel function.
