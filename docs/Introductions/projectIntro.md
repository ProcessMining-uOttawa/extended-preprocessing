### Chapter Introduction
In a recent thesis on using PM to understand user behavior in SaaS applications, Najah produced a R-based API with supporting functions that enable people to create useful and simple scrips that automating event log filtering for Process Mining. This project aimed to reproduce the API, but for Python language using Pandas, and compared the speed of Python based API with the R based API. This page provides the introduction to PM, describes the project objectives, and research questions. The tool and package selected for this project is also mentioned. At the end, we also presented my project â€˜s contributions. The conclusion of this chapter lists the outline of this project.

### Project Introduction
Processes are running everyone, and their number is rapidly increasing. The definition of a process is a series of progressive and interdependent steps by which an objective is attained. Many organizations (such as schools, companies, government agencies, universities, etc.) now use information technology systems to support Business Processes. We call a list of events recorded during the operation of information systems an event log. To better analyze these event logs, we will the technology called Process Mining (PM).
Process mining is a family of techniques relating to the fields of data science and process management and used to support the analysis of operational processes based on event logs. It can extract process maps (or models) from event logs collected by information systems. Event logs can typically be used for three types of process mining tasks (see Figure 1).
1.	Process Discovery: Process Discovery is a technique for building process models from event logs without any prior knowledge. If the event log contains resource information, resource-related models (such as social networks) can be discovered.
2.	Conformance Checking: It is a technique that compares an existing process model to an event log from that process. Conformance checking is used to verify that real process (recorded in the log) is consistent with the process model.
3.	Enhancement: improves and extends an existing process model based on insight generated by process mining.
In this project, we focus on Process Discovery.

Unfortunately, event logs from Information Systems are usually not handled directly out-of-box by process mining tools. To be effective, all PM approaches include a log filtering step to clean and simplify the event logs before feeding them to mining algorithms and process visualization engines. A recent thesis from Najah Mary EI-Gharib proposed a new API with supporting functions that enable people to create useful and simple scripts that automate event log filtering. Below is what she finished on R based APIs.

In practice, we found that APIs implemented in R languages need to be improved because the speed performance is not very good when dealing with large amounts of data. Also, additional functions such as CleanOneHeader () may also be considered along the way, to better support Robotic Process Automation.
Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open-source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. Due to its excellent data processing ability, this tool is widely used in Data Analysis. In our project, we also used Pandas to build our APIs. The following table shows the APIs we completed using Python languages.
